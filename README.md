# Diameter-height-H-D-models
Diameter-height (H-D) models are used to predict a tree's height based on its diameter, often at breast height (DBH). These models are valuable tools in forestry for various applications, including estimating tree volume, predicting dominant height, and simulating forest growth. They are particularly useful when direct height measurement is difficult or time-consuming. 

This script performs diameter-height modelling using various non-linear models in R.
